# Brain Tumor Segmentation using Hybrid GNN–Transformer Architectures

## Overview

This research project focuses on automated brain tumor segmentation from multimodal MRI using hybrid deep learning and graph-based approaches.

The objective is to improve segmentation accuracy, structural consistency, and tumor boundary refinement by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Transformer architectures, attention mechanisms, and convolutional segmentation networks.

The project explores coarse-to-fine segmentation strategies that combine region-level reasoning with voxel-level refinement for challenging medical imaging tasks.

## Problem Statement

Accurate brain tumor segmentation is critical for:

* Clinical diagnosis
* Treatment planning
* Surgical guidance
* Disease monitoring

However, brain tumors present several challenges:

* Complex morphology
* Heterogeneous appearance
* Class imbalance
* Low-contrast tumor boundaries
* Small tumor subregions

This project investigates whether graph-based reasoning and Transformer-enhanced segmentation architectures can improve segmentation performance over conventional approaches.

## Dataset

### Multimodal MRI

The framework utilizes multiple MRI modalities, including:

* T1-weighted MRI
* Contrast-enhanced T1 MRI
* T2-weighted MRI
* T2-FLAIR MRI

Each modality contributes complementary anatomical and pathological information for tumor characterization.

## Research Framework

### Stage 1: Graph-Based Coarse Segmentation

MRI slices are converted into graph representations using:

* Superpixel segmentation
* Region adjacency relationships
* Feature extraction from MRI modalities

Graph Neural Networks are then used to perform region-level tumor classification.

### Graph Components

* Superpixel Graphs
* Graph Attention Networks (GATv2)
* Graph Construction Pipelines
* Region-Level Feature Learning

The resulting graph predictions are reprojected into image space and used as structural priors for refinement.

---

### Stage 2: Deep Learning Refinement

The graph-generated tumor priors are integrated into a refinement network consisting of:

* U-Net Architectures
* Residual Convolutional Blocks
* CBAM Attention Modules
* Swin Transformer Bottlenecks

This coarse-to-fine design combines:

* Structural graph reasoning
* Local convolutional feature extraction
* Long-range Transformer attention

to improve segmentation quality and boundary precision.
